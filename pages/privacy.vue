    <h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
    The safety of your personal data is important to us. We process your data on
    the basis of the applicable legal regulations (EU General Data Protection
    Regulation GDPR, TKG 2003). In this data protection information we inform
    you about the most important aspects of data processing on our website.
    <br />
    <br />
    It is generally possible to use our website without providing any personal
    data. If you enter personal data, for example for the purpose of contacting
    us or signing up to the newsletter, we will pass on the necessary
    information to companies that process data on our behalf (e.g. our email and
    cloud providers). We only commission companies that comply with the EU
    General Data Protection Regulation.

    <h2>Server protocols</h2>
    The server from which this website is provided stores information that is
    automatically transmitted to us by your browser in so-called log files. This
    data will be automatically deleted after 2 months. They contain the
    following information:
    <br />
    <br />
    Browser type and browser version, Operating system used, Referrer URL (i.e.
    the page from which you came to us), The IP address of the accessing
    computer, Time of request
    <br />
    <br />
    This data is used for technical monitoring of the web server and for
    statistical evaluations of usage. They are not connected to other data
    sources so that they cannot be assigned to individual people.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>Encrypted transmission</h2>
    For security and data protection reasons, this website uses SSL encryption,
    which prevents third parties from intercepting and reading the data you
    enter during transmission. You can recognize active encryption by the green
    padlock or similar symbols in the address bar of your browser.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>Newsletter</h2>
    If you would like to receive the newsletter offered on the website, we need
    an email address from you as well as information that allows us to verify
    that you are the owner of the email address provided and that you agree to
    receive the newsletter. Further data is not collected. We use this data
    exclusively to send the requested information.
    <br />
    <br />
    You can revoke your consent to the storage of data, the e-mail address and
    their use to send the newsletter at any time, for example via the
    “unsubscribe” link in the newsletter.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>Your rights</h2>
    In principle, you have the rights to information, correction, deletion,
    restriction, data portability, revocation and objection. If you believe that
    the processing of your data violates data protection law or your data
    protection rights have been violated in any other way, you can complain to
    the supervisory authority. In Austria this is the data protection authority.
